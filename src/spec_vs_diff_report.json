The backend FoodItem type now includes an optional imageUrl field, the FoodCard component displays food photos with appropriate styling and fallback UI, the UploadRecipeForm includes an image URL input field, and the implementation references static assets from the public directory. However, the actual image files themselves are not present in the diff, and the seedRealData function populates all imageUrl fields with null instead of the required image paths.",
